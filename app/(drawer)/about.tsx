          This Expo project now reflects the overall direction of your Vercel prototype: a dashboard-first experience
          with career discovery, student profile details, notifications, subscription plans, and settings.

          The content is implemented as a mobile-friendly adaptation rather than a pixel-perfect web clone, which keeps
          it natural inside React Native while still matching the prototype&apos;s information architecture.
